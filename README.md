### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important
Make sure you have all dependencies before running setup script. 
##### Stow 

GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager - it creates symlinks for all files inside a directory and pass to it
In order to GNU stow to work you should place files inside this directory as if they were in your Home directory.

#### Ghostty
On linux Ghostty lives in $HOME/.config/ghostty/config and on Macos it lives in $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config.
So if your are on macos let's `export` our XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable, so ghostty can see our config on it's new location.

In your `.zshrc` add the following line:  
```bash 
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"

```

And we can delete the current config file once we wont need it. 
```bash 
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config 

```
